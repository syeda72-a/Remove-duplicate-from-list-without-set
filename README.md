# Remove-duplicate-from-list-without-set
This program removes duplicate elements from a list using a simple loop. It checks each element and adds it only once to a new list. This method keeps the original order of elements, which is important in many DSA problems.

This concept is used in:
	•	Cleaning data
	•	Finding unique elements
	•	Array manipulation
	•	Hashing and sets
	•	Interview questions related to lists and arrays

Time Complexity:
The loop method has a time complexity of O(n²). It is easy to understand and useful for beginners learning DSA.

This code helps in understanding how lists work internally and how to avoid repeated elements without using built-in functions like set(). It builds logic step by step, which is important for DSA and coding interviews.
